- **GDPR** — Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 04/27/2016, on the protection of individuals
with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.

- **Service Recipient ("user")** — refers to an individual using the Service through the Service Provider.

## 2. General Provisions
- Any issues related to the processing of personal data by the Service should be directed to the Support Server.
- The Service Provider does not currently store any personal data permanently without the Service Recipient's consent, as the Service
  currently does not have an implemented database where data necessary for continued provision of the Service would be stored.
- The Service Provider commits to responding to a message within one week from receipt of the communication.

## 3. Data Recipients
- Data of Service Recipients (in addition to being used by other external entities) is processed by the Service Provider within the utilized
  infrastructure; consequently, it is entrusted to the following recipients for enhanced and efficient service delivery and management:
  * Oracle Cloud — hosting service provider ([click to visit the site](https://www.oracle.com/cloud)).

## 4. Server Data Processing
- In the course of using the Service, the Service Provider temporarily stores the following data, which is not considered personal data but is
  necessary for the Service Recipient to display informational commands and relevant details through the program for optimal operation:
  * [Click to review the emoji data used](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/emoji#emoji-object).
  * [Click to review the channel data used](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object).
  * [Click to review the role data used](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#role-object).
- Such data is deleted upon cessation of the Service on the respective Discord server, which means after the application is removed.

## 5. User Data Processing
- As a user of any Discord server where we provide the Service, we process the following data:
  * [Click to review the user data used](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object).
- This data allows for searching and displaying information about Discord server users and performing commands quickly; if you are on a
  server where we provide the Service and wish to remove your data from storage, you should leave that server to ensure deletion.
- The legal basis for processing this data is art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, which is the legitimate interest of the Service Provider in ensuring the basic
  functionality and operation of the Service; without this, the Service would not function properly, and its features would be limited.

## 6. Other Data
- According to art. 4(1) and rec. 26 of the GDPR, this data is not considered personal data and is therefore not detailed in this
  Regulations (details in section four of the Regulations); additionally, no consent from Service Recipients is required for processing this data.
- The Service Provider also collects and processes technical information necessary for providing the Services, such as configuration settings
  set by the Service Recipient and data from Discord servers where the software has been added to count statistics with the /bot command.

## 7. Requests and Rights of Service Recipients
- Each user on a Discord server where we provide the Service has the right to:
  * access their personal data (art. 15 GDPR).
  * file a complaint with the supervisory authority (EDPS) ([click to learn more](https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-role-supervisor/complaints_en)).
  * object to the processing of their personal data when it is processed based on the legitimate interests of the Service Provider, particularly if the data is used for statistical analysis or marketing purposes (art. 21 GDPR).
  * rectify their personal data (art. 16 GDPR).
  * request the deletion of their personal data (art. 17 GDPR).
  * request the restriction of processing their personal data (art. 18 GDPR).
  * transfer their personal data (art. 20 GDPR).
  * withdraw consent for the processing of their personal data if it is being processed on that basis (art. 7 GDPR).
- To fulfill most of the above requests, simply removing the Service from the Discord server will suffice.
